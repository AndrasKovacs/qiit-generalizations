We fix levels i,j.

We have M : ToS i (1 + max(i, j + 1)) model, such that M.Con = flCwF max(i, j + 1)

"i" marks the level of external sets, "i" marks the level of internal sorts.
The bump is only needed for j, since algebras only contain elements of T : Setⱼ
sets, but internal sets are themselves elements of Setᵢ.

E.g. Nat-algebras are at level i are

  (N : Setᵢ)×(zero : N)×(suc : N → N) : Set max(0,i+1)
