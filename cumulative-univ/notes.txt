Jon Sterling cumulativity:
  - it seems to basically work as nicely as we can get
  - the context lifting rule can only be justified if we interpret
    Con as Setω or UUω.
    + In the std semantics, we interpret Γ.A as Σ Γ ↑(i,ω)A, where we
      semantically lift A to ω.
    + Context lifting rule says that Γ.A = Γ.↑(i,j)A. This works, because
      by lifting composition, ↑(j,ω)(↑(i,j)A) = ↑(i, ω)A
  - So, it seems that the benefit is that we can skip context and Sub
    lifting altogether, but the cost is that we are forced to have
    semantic ω.

Proposal: use Jon Sterling algebraic cumulativity, add some extra stuff:

  - ⊤, extensional equality type

  - admissible stuff (TODO: check)
    + i ⊔ j for levels
    + Π, Σ : n(A : Ty Γ i) → Ty (Γ ▶ A) j → Ty Γ (i ⊔ j)
    + Cumulative subtyping.
      _<_ : Ty Γ i → Ty Γ j → Ty Γ (i ⊔ j)
      _<_ A B = Id (↑A) B

      Hence, if p : Tm Γ (A < B), then Id (↑A) B, and by equality
      reflection and cumulativity Tm Γ A = Tm Γ B

  - Sterling cumulativity is nice because it's finitary QIIT with sort
    equations, also has canonicity and set-theoretic model.
